Hello, this is **Vishnu**! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jean-Francois Chamberland](https://chmbrlnd.github.io/) and [Dr. Krishna Narayanan](http://krishnanarayanan.wikidot.com/). My research interests lie in the theory of deep learning algorithms. I have previously worked on exploring the in-context learning capabilities of transformer models and am currently focusing on diffusion-based generative models, particularly for solving inverse problems. I have a solid foundation in information theory, statistical machine learning, reinforcement learning, and signal processing, complemented by a strong affinity for mathematics.

I earned a Master's degree in Signal Processing from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru, India, where I had the privilege of being advised by [Dr. Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/). I am deeply inclined towards theory-driven applications.

You can find my CV [here](../files/cv_vishnu.pdf).
