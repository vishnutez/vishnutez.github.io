Hello! I’m Vishnu, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), advised by [Dr. Jean-Francois Chamberland](https://chmbrlnd.github.io/) and [Dr. Krishna Narayanan](http://krishnanarayanan.wikidot.com/). My research focuses on the theory and design of deep learning algorithms, with current work spanning diffusion-based generative models, diffusion-LLMs, reasoning, and reinforcement learning. I also have prior experience studying in-context learning behaviors in transformer architectures.

I combine theory-driven perspectives with hands-on work using frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face (Transformers/Diffusers), TRL, Accelerate, DeepSpeed, and PEFT/LoRA. My background includes strong foundations in information theory, [high dimensional statistics](../../_technical_content/Solutions_to_HDS_Martin_Wainwright.pdf), and RL, supported by a deep interest in mathematics and principled model development. Before joining my PhD, I earned an MTech in Signal Processing from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru, where I worked with [Dr. Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/). Across my projects, I’m driven by theory-guided insights that lead to practical, reliable, and scalable AI systems.

You can find my CV [here](../_cv/ml_2025.pdf).
